## Proposal for SleepWell

We always ignore our sleeping quality and sleeping time in busy life. However, sleeping is significant for every person to keep a
healthy life. So I want to design an application to make people pay more attention on their sleeping. This application
is called **SleepWell**.

This application can be used for analyzing the sleeping quality and helping people sleeping well.
It can meet people's different needs for sleep:
- For people who always stay up late to work, SleepWell can help them record their sleeping time and remind them to sleep
  for enough time.
- For people who feel difficult to fall asleep, SleepWell will provide options of sleeping music to help them fall
  asleep quickly and improve their sleeping quality.
