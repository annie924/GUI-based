## Proposal for SleepWell

We always ignore our sleeping quality and sleeping time in busy life. However, sleeping is significant for every person to keep a
healthy life. So I want to design an application to make people pay more attention on their sleeping. This application
is called **SleepWell**.

This application can be used for analyzing the sleeping quality and helping people sleeping well.
It can meet people's different needs for sleep:
- For people who always stay up late to work, SleepWell can help them record their sleeping time and remind them to sleep
  for enough time.
- For people who feel difficult to fall asleep, SleepWell will provide options of sleeping music to help them fall
  asleep quickly and improve their sleeping quality.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add the everyday sleeping data including month, dateï¼Œsleep hour and grade of daily 
sleeping quality from 1 to 3 point to a list
- As a user, I want to be able to get a report of input sleeping data and have an option to choose all data, period data
and month data
- As a user, I want to be able to see average hour of everyday sleeping in given time interval

- As a user, I want to be able to save my everyday sleeping data list including month, date, sleep hour and grade
